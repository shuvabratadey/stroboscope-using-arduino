# What is Stroboscope ?
A stroboscope is a device that produces a rapid series of flashes of light that can be used to create a visual illusion of a stopped or slowed-down motion. Stroboscopes have various applications, including in manufacturing, research, and entertainment. In this article, we will discuss how to build a stroboscope using an Arduino board.

Hardware Design:
To build a stroboscope using an Arduino board, we will need the following components:

- An AT-Mega328P-PU Chip with a vero board (such as the Arduino Uno)
- A LED Flash Light or a high-power LED
- A resistor (for current limiting the LED)
- Two potentiometer (for adjusting the flashing frequency and duty cycle)
- An LCD Display (For displaying)
- A Box (for compact design)
- wires (for connecting the components)

The stroboscope is an intense, high speed light source used for visual analysis of objects in periodic motion and for high speed photography.
This stroboscope can measure up to 200 Hz frequency. It can be used in various industries where high-speed machinery is used. By adjusting the speed of the stroboscope the rotating part will be stopping with respect to our eyes. But It is actually not. So we can easily measure the speed of that rotating part or easily visualize the defect of that rotating part.

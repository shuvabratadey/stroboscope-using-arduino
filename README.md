# stroboscope-using-arduino
The stroboscope is an intense, high speed light source used for visual analysis of objects in periodic motion and for high speed photography.
This stroboscope can measure up to 200 Hz frequency. It can be used in various industries where high-speed machinery is used. By adjusting the speed of the stroboscope the rotating part will be stopping with respect to our eyes. But It is actually not. So we can easily measure the speed of that rotating part or easily visualize the defect of that rotating part.
